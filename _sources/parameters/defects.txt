Defects
=======

Parameters for finding defects in the lattice.

defectMethod
^^^^^^^^^^^^

0 or 1

The method to use for identifying defects in the lattice. 0 identifies
point defects by comparison to the reference lattice. 1 looks for
under coordinated atoms and creates a defect volume for each one. This
is useful when performing growth simulations where the whole surface
may be treated as a single volume using method 0.

Default: 0

vacancyRadius
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Real number

If there is no atom within this distance of a
lattice site then the site is a vacancy; if an atom is not within this
distance of a lattice site it is an interstitial.

Default: 1.0

antisiteDefects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

0 or 1

Whether antisite defects should be considered as defects during
the simulation.

vacancyDefects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

0 or 1

Whether vacancies should be considered as defects during the
simulation.

interstitialDefects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

0 or 1

Whether interstitials should be considered as defects during the
simulation.

forceSpecieDefect
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

String

Comma separated list of symbols (eg. "H\_,He" or "H\_"). Force these
elements to be considered as defects.

excludeSpecieDefect
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

String

Comma separated list of symbols (eg "H\_,He" or "H\_"). These elements
cannot be considered as defects

debugDefects
^^^^^^^^^^^^

0 or 1

Write lattice files containing interstitials, vacancies,
antisites and the subsystem

debugSearch
^^^^^^^^^^^

0 or 1

Initial displacement is a normalised vector of 1's.

timeDefectSearch
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

0 or 1

Report timings for defect searches.

speciesCoordMax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

String

Comma separated list of pairs containing the species symbol and the
maximum coordination of an under coordinated atom. For example:
"Ag,11,Zn,10".

coordMaxDefault
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Integer

The maximum coordination value for under coordinated atoms to
use for species that are not specified in `speciesCoordMax`_.
