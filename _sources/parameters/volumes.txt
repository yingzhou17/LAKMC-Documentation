Parameters regarding defect volumes

searchInitialRadius
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Real

Atoms within this distance of a defect form part of the initial search
vector, from which an atom is picked for the
initial displacement. Only atoms within this vector can be given an
initial displacement.

Typical value is 2NN.

localiseSearchRadius
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Real

Once an atom has been randomly chosen, only
atoms that are within both *localiseSearchRadius* of the chosen atom and
*searchInitialRadius* of a defect are given an initial displacement.

searchMoveRadius
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Real

Atoms within this distance of a defect can move
during the search (eg. Dimer) before switching to the convergence
algorithm.

searchConvergeRadius
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Real

This is a skin on top of the searchMoveRadius.
Atoms within (*searchMoveRadius* + *searchConvergenceRadius*) can move
during the convergence to the saddle point (eg. Lanczos).

graphRadius
^^^^^^^^^^^

Real

Radius to use when building the graph key.

volumesConstructNew
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

0 or 1

Treat nearby volumes differently. Instead of fusing into one
volume, keep as individual and have a combined volume. Don't use unless
you know what it does.
