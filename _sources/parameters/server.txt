Server
======

Parameters for the server. These values should probably be left at their defaults
unless you know what you are doing.

serverMinPort
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Integer

Set the minimum port the server can run on. 

If serverMinPort < serverMaxPort a port within the range is randomly chosen.

If set to -1 a port is chosen automatically.

Default is 8888

serverMaxPort
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Integer

Set the maximum port the server can run on.

If serverMinPort < serverMaxPort a port within the range is randomly chosen.

If set to -1 a
port is chosen automatically.

Default is 9999

numberOfWriterProcesses
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Integer >= 1

This is not used currently and setting it has no effect.

clientIndividualOutput
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

0 or 1

Each worker process writes to its own standard output and error
files. Obviously this generates a lot more files (total size will be the
same) but is very useful when debugging/checking everything is working.
For production runs it may be better to set to 0 but if you want to be
able to easily see what the workers are doing leave it as 1.

Default is 1

maxIdleTime
^^^^^^^^^^^

Real (seconds)

During transition searches if no result is received during this period of time
the programme will terminate.

Default is 1800.0

debugServer
^^^^^^^^^^^

0 or 1

Plot load/timings from worker processes at the end of a task.

Default is 0
