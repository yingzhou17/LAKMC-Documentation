Basin
=====

Parameters for the basin method.

basinReset
^^^^^^^^^^

0 or 1 - 1: for a resuming job, ignore all basin built and stored
before, and start building new basins; - 0: for a resuming job, read in
all basin built and stored before, and continuing build and use these
basins. Default: 0

basinCOMTol
^^^^^^^^^^^

Float When checking a volume is a basin states or not, the tolerance of
checking center of mass. Default: 0.4

basinMomentTol
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Float > 0.0 When checking a volume is a basin states or not, the
tolerance of checking moment. Default: 0.1

basinLowBarrier
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Float > 0.0 If both forward and reverse barriers are lower than this
value, this transition is regarded as a basin event. Default: 0.1

basinTransSep
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Float > 0.0 For two transitions, if the separation of saddles are
smaller than this value, we assume they are identical. Default: 0.5

basinSepTol
^^^^^^^^^^^

Float > 0.0 Even the hash keys of two volumes are different, we still
check the separation of these two volumes. If the separation is smaller
than this value, we assume these volumes are identical. Default: 1.0

debugBasin
^^^^^^^^^^

0 or 1 If 1, debug mode of basin method. Will print out information
about the basin, e.g. origin/basin rates, whole built basin info, chosen
transition's basin info, etc. Default: 0
