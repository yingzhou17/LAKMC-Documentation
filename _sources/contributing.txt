Contributing to the documentation
=================================

Introduction
------------

Documentation will be written using 'numpydoc' and 'sphinx'. We will write the documentation into 
the docstrings_ and use sphinx/numpydoc to convert 
this to html.

Requirements
------------

* Sphinx_ can be installed using MacPorts:
  
  .. code:: sh
  
    sudo port install py27-sphinx
    sudo port select --set sphinx py27-sphinx

* numpydoc_ can be installed using pip_:
  
  .. code:: sh
  
    pip install --user numpydoc
  
  **Note**: 'pip' may be named 'pip-2.7' if using MacPorts and you haven't ``port selected`` pip2.7. 
  If you don't specify '--user' you may need to 'sudo' (unless installing within a virtualenv).

Guidelines
----------

To ensure the documentation is consistent we should all follow the guide_ to NumPy/SciPy documentation, 
in particular the names and order of sections within the docstrings. Note, the layout is different 
for module, class and method docstrings. Lines should be kept within 80 characters so it displays 
properly when viewed from a terminal.

Building the documentation
--------------------------

This is also described in the README.md file.  In the main directory run:

````````````````````````````
python setup.py build_sphinx
````````````````````````````

and the html documentation should be placed in 'build/sphinx/html' (open 'build/sphinx/html/index.html' 
in your browser).
